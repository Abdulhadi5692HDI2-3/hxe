This programming language was made with the Crafting Interpreters book and is technically
a superset of Lox with some changes.

[x] you can use the modulo operator
[x] Inheritance happens with `class Apple : Fruit` not `class Apple < Fruit`
[ ] Imports and exports
[ ] other things that i dont have time to write
