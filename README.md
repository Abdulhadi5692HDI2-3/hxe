# hxe
This programming language was made with the Crafting Interpreters book and is technically
a superset of Lox with some changes.

# changes
- [x] Functions are declared with `function` not `fn`
- [x] you can use the modulo operator
- [x] Inheritance happens with `class Apple : Fruit` not `class Apple < Fruit`
- [x] Imports (i've decided that import is just enough for now)
- [ ] A proper Standard Library (you can guess that is going to be a bit easier now with importing module support)
- [ ] other things that i dont have time to write
